# FasterCNN-Object-Detection
In this project, I am performing object detection on a specific image. The main tools used in this project are TensorFlow and PIL. The model we use as a detector in this project is the Faster-CNN model trained on Open Images V4 with ImageNet pre-trained Inception ResNet V2 as its feature extractor. Various images can be inputted into the model in this project, but if there is an image that has never been recognized by the model, the detector will not mark that object with a bounding box.
